# CS 265: Final Project

This course features a project component.

You may do the project individually or in groups of 2-3 people.
Unlike the reflection assignments, 
 you should submit a single project report for the group.

You cannot use late days on the project.
If you think you will need an extension, please talk to me as soon as possible.

See the [schedule](./README.md#schedule) for due dates.

**If you are in a group**,
 have one person submit the proposal/check-in/report and list the group members in the proposal.
The others should just submit a text entry saying that they are in a group with that person.

## Project Proposals

The first part of the project is to write a proposal.

The purpose of the proposal is to help you scope out project 
 that is both interesting and feasible
 to complete in the time allotted.

The proposal should be at least 2-3 pages long and should be submitted as a PDF on bCourses.

The proposal should include the following sections:

- Intro
    - What are you doing?
    - What is your goal?
    - Why?
- Background
    - What do you already know or need to learn to do this project?
    - What pieces of infrastructure will you need? Bril? LLVM? Doop?
        - Are you already familiar with these? Or will you need to learn them?
    - What parts are already done?
- Approach
    - How will you accomplish the things that need to be done?
    - What software will you need to build? Algorithms to implement? Papers to read?
- Evaluation plan
    - How will you know if you've succeeded?
    - What will you measure?

I will broadly accept projects that are related to any part of compilation, not just the middle-end that we focused on in class.

Here are some (non-exhaustive) categories that I expect to see projects in:
1. Expanding your Bril compiler
    - Pick a new optimization or class of optimzations to implement and measure
        - I expect this will be the most common project, and that's great!
    - Expand the Bril infrastructure in some way
        - Generate Bril from a new source language
        - Add new IR features (parallelism, virtual functions, etc.)
        - Implement a backend to a real or virtual architecture
2. Any of the above in some other compiler infrastructure
    - probably only do this if you already have experience with the infrastructure
3. Connecting up with your current research project / hobby project
    - If you're already working on a project that involves compilation
    - Still follow the project guidelines above re: goal setting and evaluation
4. Survey paper
    - If you're not interested in implementing something, you can write a survey paper on a topic in compilation
    - Still follow the project guidelines above re: goal setting
    - "Evaluation" will be a more nuanced reflection on how your report compares with the state of the art. What doesn't it cover?

 see what students in the similar [CS 6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/blog/) course at Cornell did in that instance or others.

## Project Check-ins

TBD, this will be a short report on your progress, i.e., how you are doing with respect to your proposed goals.
There will be ample opportunity to work on your project and meet with me during office hours before and after this.
