# CS 265: Final Project

**!! Under construction !!**

This course will feature a project component.

Projects will be proposed during the course of the semester,
 and they will be submitted in written form during finals week.

You may do the project individually or in groups of 2-3 people.
Unlike the reflection assignments, 
 you may submit a single project report for the group.

See the [schedule](./README.md#schedule) for due dates.
