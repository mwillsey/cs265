This paper should be mostly accessible given the lecture material.

Section 4 is the payoff,
 showing off the cool things you can find beyond 
 standard linear induction variables.
Don't get too bogged down in the details here.

Section 6 will discuss dependence analysis,
 which we have not covered in class.
You should still skim this part,
 as it's a good primer for when we do cover it.
