Read Sections 1, 2, 3.1, (skip the rest of 3, 4, 5), and read 6-8.

The skipped sections discuss reducible vs irreducible control flow graphs, 
 which we will cover in more later in the course.

One thing to look out for in this paper is the focus on efficiency (of compilation time).
In fact, that was also the original motivation for SSA form
 as we saw in last week's reading.
Another thing (also present in last week's reading) is the combination of optimizations,
 running them together in a single pass.
