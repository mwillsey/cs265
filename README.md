## Logistics

The course material will be made available online in the form of lecture notes.
There will not be recordings of lecture.

Assignments mostly take the form of written reflections, 
 which will be turned in on [bCourses][].
A reflection should roughly a paragraph at minimum, 
 I will read them!

The course will feature the following assignments:
- **Reading reflections**:
  - These are short reflections on the papers that we read in the course.
  - These should be done individually.
  - Include questions you may have about the paper, 
    whether or not you liked it, 
    and what you learned from it.
  - These are due **at noon** the day of the class where the paper is discussed.
  - Discussion participation will be holistically included in this grade.
- **Implementation tasks**:
  - May be done individually or groups of 2-3 people.
  - Your work will not be turned in our automatically graded, 
    but will have to discuss your work in a reflection.
    - I reserve the right to ask for a demonstration of your work.
  - Reflection should still be written and submitted _individually_.
    - Include your group members in the reflection.
    - Include a brief description of what you personally contributed.
    - Include discussion of the major design decisions and challenges in the implementation.
    - Show off! Includes some code snippets, figures, or other artifacts that you think are particularly interesting.
    - You may share some text/figures/code between group members' reflection.
  - Do the work!
    - Pretty much everything in this class has been done before.
    - You can easily find solutions online. I will even provide some in the course infrastructure.
    - You may look at any of these resources, 
      but you must acknowledge them (not include resources from this course) in your reflection.
- **Final project**: see [project page](project.md) for more details.

### Grading

The assignments from this course will be graded according to 
 a "[Michelin star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide#Stars)" system
 (borrowed from [Adrian Sampson's](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/syllabus/#grading) policy):
- **One star**: The work is high-quality.
- **Two star**: The work is excellent.
- **Three star**: The work is exceptional.

On bCourses, this will appear as a 0-1 scale.
Work below the "high-quality" threshold will receive zero stars.
Earning one star is the goal for all assignments, and consistently doing so will earn an A in the course.
Consistently earning multiple stars will earn an A+.


## Resources

These notes are by no means meant to be a comprehensive resource for the course.
As the [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) section notes, 
 there are many other great resources out there.
Here are just a few that I recommend for this course:

- [CS 6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/) by Adrian Sampson, including lecture videos.
- [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15411-f14/schedule.html) by Frank Pfenning, including comprehensive lecture notes.
- The book _[Static Program Analysis](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/)_  by Anders MÃ¸ller and Michael I. Schwartzbach 
  (available online for free).
- The survey paper "[Compiler transformations for high-performance computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/197405.197406)" (1994)
  for a comprehensive look at many parts of an optimizing compiler, especially loop transformations.


## Acknowledgements

This course and these notes are heavily influenced by 
 Adrian Sampson's [CS6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/)
 and Frank Pfenning's [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15411-f14/schedule.html).
Thanks to them for creating great material! 
You are encouraged to refer to them (and other sources) throughout the course, 
 but note there may be differences/inconsistencies between them, 
 especially as it relates the specifics of the programming assignments.
