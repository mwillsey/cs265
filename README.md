## Resources

These notes are by no means meant to be a comprehensive resource for the course.
As the [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) section notes, 
 there are many other great resources out there.
Here are just a few that I recommend for this course:

- [CS 6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/) by Adrian Sampson, including lecture videos.
- [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15411-f14/schedule.html) by Frank Pfenning, including comprehensive lecture notes.
- The book _[Static Program Analysis](https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/)_  by Anders MÃ¸ller and Michael I. Schwartzbach 
  (available online for free).
- The survey paper "[Compiler transformations for high-performance computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/197405.197406)" (1994)
  for a comprehensive look at many parts of an optimizing compiler, especially loop transformations.

## Acknowledgements

This course and these notes are heavily influenced by 
 Adrian Sampson's [CS6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/)
 and Frank Pfenning's [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15411-f14/schedule.html).
Thanks to them for creating great material! 
You are encouraged to refer to them (and other sources) throughout the course, 
 but note there may be differences/inconsistencies between them, 
 especially as it relates the specifics of the programming assignments.
