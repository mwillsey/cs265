# Syllabus

See the [README](README.md) for general course information, including the schedule.

If you need support outside of context of the course,
 please feel free to contact me 
 or use the [UC Berkeley Supportal](https://supportal.berkeley.edu/home)
 to access resources for mental health, basic needs, and more.

**Caveat lector**:
 This course is under construction.
 That means that these documents are subject to change!
 That also means you are welcome to provide feedback to me about the course.

## Communication

Course announcements, assignments, grading, and discussion will be on bCourses.

## Course materials

The course material will be made available here in the form of lecture notes.
As these materials are open-source,
 you may provide direct edits to course materials (either here or in other course repos)
 via pull requests if you feel so inclined, but it is not at all required.
Issues and PRs to this repo are for typos, broken links, and other technical issues.
Questions and course discussion should be directed to the bCourses forum.

## Class

Some classes will be a lecture, 
 some will be a discussion of a paper.
Some classes (or portions of classes) 
 will be dedicated to working on or discussing the implementation tasks.
These portions are not required (you may leave class early if you wish), 
 but I will be available to help you with the tasks.

The lecture notes are not designed to be a replacement for attending class.
There will not be recordings of class.

## Assignments

Assignments mostly take the form of written reflections, 
 which will be turned in on bCourses.
I will read them!

**NOTE**: The point of the reflections is to tell me **your thoughts** and **your decisions**.
Yes, they are also there to ensure you actually did the assignment. 
But keep in mind that **I know the course material already**, and **I have read the paper**.
You **do not** need to re-explain the course material or the paper to me;
 you may use terms and assume I know what they mean.
You **do** need to tell me what you're thinking:
 things you found interesting,
 things you found challenging or got stuck on,
 decisions you made and how you made them,
 insights you had beyond what's in the course material,
 and so on.

The course will feature the following assignments:
- **Reading reflections**:
  - These are short reflections on the papers that we read in the course.
  - These should be done individually.
  - A reflection should roughly a paragraph at minimum.
  - Do not summarize the paper.
    - Assume that I have read the paper.
    - Include questions you may have about the paper, 
        whether or not you liked it, 
        and what you learned from it.
  - These are due **at noon** the day of the class where the paper is discussed.
  - Discussion participation will be holistically included in this grade.
- **Implementation tasks**:
  - May be done individually or groups of 2-3 people.
  - Your work will not be turned in our automatically graded, 
    but you will have to discuss your work in a reflection.
    - I reserve the right to ask for a demonstration of your work.
  - Reflection should still be written and submitted _individually_.
    - Include your group members in the reflection.
    - Include a brief description of what you personally contributed.
    - Include a link to your work.
      - I encourage you to use a public git repository, 
        but you may use a private one if you wish. 
        Just invite me to it.
    - Include discussion of the major design decisions and challenges in the implementation.
    - Show off! Includes some code snippets, figures, or other artifacts that you think are particularly interesting.
    - You may share some text/figures/code between group members' reflection.
  - Do the work!
    - Pretty much everything in this class has been done before.
    - You can easily find solutions online. I will even provide some in the course infrastructure.
    - You may look at any of these resources, 
      but you must acknowledge them (not include resources from this course) in your reflection.
      I encourage you to do the work without looking at these resources at first!
- **Final project**: see [project page](project.md) for more details.

## Grading

The assignments from this course will be graded according to 
 a "[Michelin star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide#Stars)" system
 (borrowed from [Adrian Sampson's](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/syllabus/#grading) policy):
- **One star**: The work is high-quality.
- **Two star**: The work is excellent.
- **Three star**: The work is exceptional.

On bCourses, this will appear as an assignment score out of 1 point. 
Work below the "high-quality" threshold will receive zero stars (points).
Earning one star is the goal for all assignments, and consistently doing so will earn an A in the course.
Consistently earning multiple stars will earn an A+.

## Late Policy

The assignment deadlines are designed to help you pace yourself through the course.
That said, you do have late days to use throughout the semester.

1. You have 10 "late days" to use throughout the semester.
2. Late days are counted in 24-hour increments, 1 minute late is 1 late day.
3. Reading reflections **cannot be turned in late**.
